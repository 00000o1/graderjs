- somehow when using spawn or fork (both work), I cannot access the internal filesystem anymore 
so i need to write the app to a temp directory. In order for that to work, I need to write the whole app to a temp directory.

So what I think I'll do is:

- add a build step that zips up our website / app directory
- add the website zip into the nexe build
- write the server.js and website zip to a temp directory 
- unzip the website zip
- start the server
- on close delete the temp directory
