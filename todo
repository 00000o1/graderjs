- write config (grader.config.js) spec to set your app name, etc etc
- handle case where a server process still exists form last launch (kill it? probably.)
- handle cleanup (delete temp dir, etc)
- put archivist in this framework.
- write documentation about how to use grader to build cross-platform apps (grader-create-app ?)
