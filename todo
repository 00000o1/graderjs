Priority
  - multiple windows handling
  - put archivist in this framework.
  - improve API based on what I learned from porting and 
  - write documentation about how to use grader to build cross-platform apps 

Lesser
  - implement apiInUI flag
  - improve progress . metrics (no clearline just add 1 dot on each turn using stdout.write)
  - add sessionIds to old-sessions on every exit path from the app (even before UI launched for example)
  - add security checks on origin for API proxy
