# Grader.JS

Grader.JS, or just **Grader**, is a tool to help you build cross-platform desktop apps in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, without the bloat of Electron.

# Get Started

```js
import Grader from 'graderjs';

start();

async function start() {
  await Grader.go();
}
```

You now have a GUI app in Node.JS and JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
