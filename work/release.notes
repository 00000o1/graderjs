I think it's easier to make it like a create-app or a template repo.

Because ...

To have these apps an author needs 2 parts:

1) Grader API and code
2) Build their code into a binary

And 2 requires 

3) Correct structure of their code

There could be a post install script, that sets up 3.

And also copies all the required build scripts.

And also sets up their config.

This is an option.

--- but


I think at the start, it's easier just to make it a template repository.
